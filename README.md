# odin-browser-ttt

This project I set out to create a browser based game of Tic Tac Toe, using Javascript for the functionality behind it.

Key concepts taught in this project were how factories and modules worked in Javascript, and utilizing them to their fullest to create an interactive page.

I also set out the goal for myself to use as little HTML as possible, instead choosing to rely on creating elements dynamically through Javascript. Alot of problems I ran into along the way could have been alot easier by simply hard coding the board, but creating a dynamic board that doesn't exist until the button was pressed allowed me to get alot more practice in both creating elements in the DOM and adding classes to them as I went.

I tried to style the game in the same vein as my personal website, as this project will likely just be an extension off of that. Bootstrap was utilized once again, as I continue to attempt to get a better handle on creating responsive beautiful layouts with Bootstrap. My design skills still are lacking, but at least the current CSS skills I have are slowly improving to where I can throw together something not half bad in an hour or two.

Potential future idea for expansion of idea - an online version of the game, with two computers playing each other in a lobby. I think that could be a fun challenge for myself to deal with the networking complexities that could come with that.
